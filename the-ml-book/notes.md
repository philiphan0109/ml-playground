## 2.1 Notation

### Data Structures
- A **scalar** is a simple numeric value: like 3 or -2.4.
- A **vector** is an ordered list of scalar values, called attributes. A vector is usually denoted by a bold character, like $\textbf{w}$ or $\textbf{x}$. The index $j$, denotes a speciic **dimension** of the vector, the position of an attribute in the list: $\textbf{w}^{(j)}$.
- A **matrix** is a rectangular array of number arranged in rows and columns. It's denoted as a capital letter - it's exactly what you think a matrix would be.
- A **set** is na unordered collection of unique elements. A set is denoted as a calligraphic capital character. A set is just a gorup of items, it can have infinite or finite size.
- **Unions** and **Intersections** of sets are easy and the reader can just look them up.

### Capital *Sigma* Notation

The summation over a collection of items $X$ or over the attributes of a vector $\textbf{x}$ is denoted as:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\textbf{x}^{(j)}}
$$

### Capital *Pi* Notation

This is easy, instead of summing all the elements of a collection, you find the product.

### Operations on Sets

A derived set creation operator looks like this: $S' \leftarrow \{x^2 | x \in S, x > 3 \}$. This notation means that we create a new set $S'$ by putting into it $x$ squared such that $x$ is in $S$, and that $x$ is greater than 3.

The cardinality operator $|S|$ return the number of elements in the set $S$.

### Operations on Vectors

- The sum of two vectors is their element-wise sum.

- The difference of two vectors is their element-wise difference.

- A vector multiplied by a scalar is their element-wise product.

- A **dot-product** of two vectors is a scalar. Please tell me you know what the dot product is...

- A matrix times a vector is another vector.

### Functions

A **function** is a relation that associates each element $x$ of a set $X$, the **domain** of the function to a single element $y$ of another set $Y$, the **codomain** of the function. 
- You should know what a **local minimum** is.
- An **interval** is a set of real numbers with the property than any number that lies between two numbers is in also included in the set.
    - An **open interval** does not include the endpoints and is denoted using parentheses ().
    - A **closed intercal** does include the endpoints and is denoted using brackets [].
- The minimum value among all the locl minima is called the **global minimum**.
- Note: A function can return a vector $y$, even if the input is a scalar $x$, this is called a vector function.

### Max and Arg Max
Given a set of values $A$, the $max_{a \in A}{f(a)}$ returns the highest value $f(a)$ for all elements in the set $A$.

The operator $argmax_{a \in A}{f(a)}$ returns the element of the set $A$ that maximizes $f(a)$.

$min$ and $argmin$ work the same way.

### Derivative and Gradient
I will not talk too much about this section. 
- Know how to get the derivative of a function $f$.
- Know what the chain rule is.

The **gradient** is the generalization of derivative for functions that take multiple inputs. A gradient of a function is a vector of the **partial derivatives** of that function. A partial derivative can be obtained by focusing on one of the function's inputs and assuming taht all other inputs are constant values.

For example, consider a function $f([x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}]) = ax^{(1)} + bx^{(2)} + c$, then the partial derivative of the function $f$ with respect to $x^{(1)}$, denoted as $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{(1)}}$:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{(1)}} = a + 0 + 0 = a
$$

I hope this makes sense. 

The gradient of a function $f$, denoted as $\nabla f$ is given by the vector $[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{(1)}}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{(2)}}]$.

## 2.2 Random Variable

A **random variable** usually written as an italic capital letter, like *X*, is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon - these variables can come from any phenomenon with a random numeric outcome like a dice roll. There are two types of random variables: **discrete** and **continuous**.

- A **discrete random variable** takes on only a countable number of distinct values such as 1, 2, 3, ..., or red, yellow, blue.
    - The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is described by a list of proababilities called a **probability mass function** (pmf): $Pr(X = heads) = 0.5$ and $Pr(X = tails) = 0.5$
- A **continuous random variable** (CRV) takes an infinite number of possible values in some interval. Because the number of values of a continuous random variable $X$ is infinite, the probability $PR(X = c)$ for any $c$ is 0. 
    - The probability distrubution of a CRV is described by a **probability density function** (pdf).

Let a discrete random variable $X$ have $k$ possible values $\{x_i\}^k_{i=1}$. The **expectation** of $X$ denoted by $E[X]$ is given by:
$$
E[X] = \sum^k_{i=1}{[x_i \cdot Pr(X = x_i)]}
$$
Where Pr($X = x_i$) is the probability that $X$ has the value $x_i$ according to the pmf. The expectation of a random variable is also called the **mean**, **average**, or **expected value** and is denoted with the letter $\mu$. 

The expectation of a continuous random variable $X$ is given by:

$$
E[X] = \int_{\mathbb{R}}{x_if_X(x)}dx
$$

where $f_x$ is the pdf of the variable X.

I hope this makes intuitive sense because this is important.

- Know **standard deviation** and **variance**.

Most of the time, we don't know the function $f$ in machine learning, but we can obser some values of $X$. These values are called **examples**, and the collections of these examples is called a **sample** or **dataset**.

## 2.3 Unbiased Estimators

Because $f_x$ is usually unknown, we can use sample $S_X = \{x_i\}^N_{i=1}$ to generate the **unbiased estimators** of the function.

- Okay, this doesn't make any sense to me.

## 2.4 Bayes' Rule

The conditional probability Pr($X = x$ | $Y = y$) is the probability tof the random variable $X$ to have a value of $x$ *given* that another random variable $Y$ has a specific value of $y$. The **Bayes' Rule** says:

$$
Pr(X = x | Y = y) = \frac{Pr(Y=y|X=x)Pr(X = x)}{Pr(Y = y)}
$$
